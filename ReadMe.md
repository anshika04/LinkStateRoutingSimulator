# Link State Routing Protocol Simulator

GUI based Java program to simulate and modify Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm to find shortest path between two routers and generate interface table.

Key Features:

1. Add Routers. Generate netwok topology at each step.
2. Create interface table.
3. Determine shortest path between two routers
4. Delete Router
5. Router idle/breakdown/disable
6. Best router in the input topology
